# Todo

- Add overlay grid for cars etc:
	- For this, each tile of the normal grid contains not only the background img but also another div "overlay" with:
    - position: absolute
    - z-index: 1 (higher number for other overlays, then)
    - height: 101%, width: 101% (100 might be fine, too, but let's keep the tradition)
  - The background tile does not need any special css, damn. No idea how I missed that earlier.
  - How to position cars correctly though? Idea (doesn't work for signs):
    - div.subject-placement:
      - (maybe:) height: 100%
      - (maybe:) width: 100%
      - display: flex
      - align-content: center (?)
      - justify-content: space-around
      - align-items: flex-end (ONLY for right cause margin-left works weirdly)
      - margin-top: 
        - bottom: 45% 
        - top: 10%
        - left/right: null/none
      - margin-left:
        - left: 10%
        - right: ? weird, probably needs margin-right 
    - div.subject-placement > img.subject: // important: include EMPTY img if no subject is there for space-around to work!
      - (max-)height: 45%? (for left/right: 27%)
      - (max-)width: 27%? (for left/right: 49%)
      - height and width are probably not solid numbers
- Fix current generation problems
- Do circs really need "needsRoadForward", "needsRoadLeft" and "needsRoadRight"? They could be inferred from subjects' turn signals and grid positions
- Check if it's possible for each rule set to define their own answers without collecting them all in one enum.
  - see right-of-way.service.ts#possibleDoAnswers
- road-utils.ts: Change GridPositions to cyclic doubly linked list? BOTTOM would be index 0 (can be used alongside an enum)
  - Example call: `grid[GridPosition.BOTTOM].right` would get the right road from the POV of a bottom car
- situation.service.ts: Other rule systems, no only DO_QUESTION.
- The current road calculation ignores it's possible to turn into a garage rather than street, sadly.
